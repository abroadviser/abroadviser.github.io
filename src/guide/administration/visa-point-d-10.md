# Visa Point System- Job Seeking Visa D-10 

D-10 Visa, is a Job Seeking Visa, granted for 6 months, in order to help students who finished their degree time to look for a job (from D-2 to D-10)

While having D-10 visa  you are able to work as an intern but not as permanent employee (for that you need E series visa). If you are employed under any conditions that are not legal to this visa, you will be excluded from this visa type.
