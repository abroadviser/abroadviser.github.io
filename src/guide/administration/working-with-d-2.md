# Working Options with D-2 Visa 

If you are a holder of a D-2 visa and you are in the middle of studies, but want to work, there is such possibility.

In the past, there was obligation to apply for work permit in order to do so, however, these days you can work when getting a written permission from your university. (there might be a need for immigration permission, S-3, in specific cases)

You can only work as **Part- Time**, with some conditions and limitations to your work.

**Hours Limitation:**
Undergraduate student: 20 hours/ week, on weekdays
Graduate student: 30 hours/ week, on weekdays, max. of 2 work places.

**Type of Work Limitations:**
The type of work must be related to the study field/ subject. However, the work cannot be professional level work (e.g: finance analyst, marketing expert etc.) It should be starting level/ administration.
Private tutoring, Language teaching is usually prohibited ( if you want to have this kind of job, you will need to apply in the immigration office)
