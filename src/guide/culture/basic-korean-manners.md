# Basic Korean Manners That is Good to Know

If you are looking to make a good impression when meeting Korean people there are some small actions you can do that will go a long way. 

Whether it's your colleagues, classmates, manager, or someone you meet for the first time, you can use the following

1. Bow or make a small head nod to greet others

2. Hold objects (business card, credit card etc.) with both hand as sign of respect to others

3. End with the word "Nim" when calling others 

4. Use titles instead of names to call others 

5. Wait for older (or higher position) people to make the first move when meeting (business meeting, casual meeting, having a meal etc.)

6. Try to sit straight with hands on the side of the body (or legs) in meetings 

Those are some guidelines we suggest to do, the first two are very common to see as they are used by everyone from young to older.
