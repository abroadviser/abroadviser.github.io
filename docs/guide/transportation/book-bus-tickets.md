# "How to" - Booking Express Bus Tickets 

If you are planning a trip inside Korea, and considering taking the bus, you don't have to go to the terminal in order to buy your ticket. You can easily do it through Kobus [website](https://www.kobus.co.kr/main.do) (or app, but it is only in Korean) as follow:

Go to the website and choose the language you want (this explanation is for English)

Read and agree to the cancellation terms. it is recommended to read it and not just agree as you might need to cancel your ticket later on, so this way you will know what to do/ pay if you cancel.

The next step is to agree to the Terms of Use and create a one time password for your purchase. With this password you can make changes and cancel the ticket if needed.

After you press "Pay" it will process the payment, once completed you are done!

We also recommend you to download the app, this way, you do not need to print the ticket, but will get a bar-code to use when going on the bus. so it is easy and quick!
The app is all in Korean but intuitive to use, even if you do not understand Korean
