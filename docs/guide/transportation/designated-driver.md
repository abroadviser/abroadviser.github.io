# Designated Driver

If you find yourself in a situation that you can not drive (too tired or not capable) and you have your car with you, you can call/ order a designated driver service (대리운전)

This person will come to where you are and will drive you in your car to the address you provide. The price for this service will change based on the locations (from and where to) but it is considered quite reasonable especially thinking of the risks of driving yourself.

With this kind of service, you get to your destination safely with your car 
This type of service is currently provided only in Korean.

Here are some options:

- Park's designated driver: 2588- 2588 
- 'Kakao Driver' app
- Or search 대리운전 in Naver (there are many options based on cities)

::: tip
Benchmark: From a personal experience, between places inside Seoul it cost around 30,000~50,000
